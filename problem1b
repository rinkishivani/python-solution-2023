Problem 1: Program to count occurrences of a given character in a string.

 (b) Count character '3' in the below string.
	Input "abccdefgaa."
	Output : 3

'''
Note: I'm suspecting that the question parameters maybe incorrect as the output given is '3' or vise versa. According to the question output will be zero.

# take user input (considered captital and small both)
userinput = input("Enter a word to count the number of '3' \n")

# initial value for count variable
count = 0

# counter loop for 
for c in userinput:
    # print(c)
    if c == "3":
        count += 1
    
print("word:", userinput)
print("'3' count:", count)
